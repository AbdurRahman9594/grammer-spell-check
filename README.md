In the YouTubers project, the Gingerit module is no longer available. Therefore, I have used Language Tool, instead of Gingerit. Therefore, when you copy this code and paste it into VS code or any other Code editor, then first install the packages using pip install package_name and then run the code. Please don't directly run the code.
Also, please create a "templates" folder, inside which you should paste the index.html file. Then only the render_template will work perfectly.
Note: Please refer to the "Folder photo".
