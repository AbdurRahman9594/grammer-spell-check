In the YoutTubers project, Gingerit module is no longer available. Therefore, I have used Language Tool, instead of Gingerit. Therefore, when you copy this code and paste it in VS code or any other Code editor, then firstly install the packages using pip install package_name and then run the code. Please don't directly run the code.
